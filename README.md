# Dijkstra_Algorythm
This codig project has been made for my subject ENGR 476 Computer Communications Network.
We should be able to recreate the behaviour of Dijkstra Algorythm. It receives a costs file where the values are introduced as a matrix. Nodes that are not connected between each other have a cost of 500 instead of infinity.
